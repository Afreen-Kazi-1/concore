# The CONTROL-CORE Framework.
[CONTROL-CORE](https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/) is a framework for closed-loop peripheral neuromodulation control systems. 

The CONTROL-CORE framework consists of the below projects.

* _concore_: The CONTROL-CORE protocol, known as _concore_, allows modular simulation of controller and PM nodes to run on different operating systems, computing platforms, and programming languages. [This repository](https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/concore/) consists of _concore_ source code. The _concore_ documentation can be found [here](https://control-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). For a more scientific documentation, please read our extensive [open-access research paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3161471).

* _concore_ Editor: This is the front-end for CONTROL-CORE. We forked [DHGWorkflow](https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/DHGWorkflow), a sibling project we developed, and extend as the _concore_ Editor.

* _Mediator_

* _concore-lite_


# Configuring _concore_

concore is a lightweight Python-based protocol to simulate neuromodulation control systems. Installation instructions for concore can be found [here](https://control-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
